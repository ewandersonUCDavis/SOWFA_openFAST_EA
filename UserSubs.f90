   ! NOTE: This source file contains dummy placeholders for ALL of the

   !          Routine       Description
   !          ------------  ---------------------------------------------------
   !          PitchCntrl()  User-specified blade pitch control (either
   !                        independent or rotor-collective) model.
   !          UserGen()     User-specified generator torque and power model.
   !          UserHSSBr()   User-specified high-speed shaft brake model.
   !          UserPtfmLd()  User-specified platform loading model.
   !          UserRFrl()    User-specified rotor-furl spring/damper model.

   !                        control model.
   !          UserYawCont() User-specified nacelle-yaw control model.
   !       In order to interface FAST with your own user-specified routines,
   !       you can develop your own logic within these dummy placeholders and
   !       recompile FAST; OR comment out the appropriate dummy placeholders,
   !       create your own routines in their own source files, and recompile
   !       FAST while linking in these additional source files.  For example,
   !       the executable version of FAST that is distributed with the FAST
   !       archive is linked with the example PitchCntrl() routine contained in
   !       source file PitchCntrl_ACH.f90 and the example UserGen() and
   !       UserVSCont() routines contained in source file UserVSCont_KP.f90;
   !       thus, the dummy placeholders for routines PitchCntrl(), UserGen(),
   !       and UserVSCont() are commented out within this source file.  The
   !       example pitch controller was written by Craig Hansen (ACH) and the
   !       example generator and variable speed controllers were written by
   !       Kirk Pierce (KP).  Please see the aforementioned source files for
   !       additional information on these example user-specified routines.

   ! NOTE: If you (the user) wants to access the current value of ANY of the
   !       output parameters available as outputs from FAST from your
   !       user-defined routines, then do the following:
   !          (1) USE MODULE Output() in your routine.
   !          (2) Access the output parameter by typing "AllOuts(OutName)",
   !              where OutName is the PRIMARY name of the output parameter.
   !              For example, to access the current value of the in-plane
   !              bending moment at the root of blade 1 (in kN·m), type in
   !              "AllOuts(RootMxc1)", since RootMxc1 is the primary name of
   !              this output parameter--RootMIP1 will not work in place of
   !              RootMxc1, since it is a SECONDARY name.  Also, you CANNOT use
   !              the prefixes ("-", "_", "m", or "M") in front of OutName to
   !              reverse the sign of the selected output channel.
   !       Note that OutName DOES NOT have to be one of the output parameters
   !       you listed in OutList from your primary input file.  Also note that
   !       this technique WILL also work for user-defined routines written for
   !       ADAMS datasets extracted using the FAST-to-ADAMS preprocessor.

   ! relevant control parameters.

SUBROUTINE UserPtfmLd ( X, XD, ZTime, DirRoot, PtfmAM, PtfmFt )


   ! This is a dummy routine for holding the place of a user-specified
   ! platform loading model.  Modify this code to create your own model.
   ! The local variables and associated calculations below provide a
   ! template for making this user-specified platform loading model
   ! include linear 6x6 damping and stiffness matrices.  These are
   ! provided as an example only and can be modified or deleted as
   ! desired by the user without detriment to the interface (i.e., they
   ! are not necessary for the interface).

   ! The platform loads returned by this routine should contain contributions
   !   from any external load acting on the platform other than loads
   !   transmitted from the wind turbine.  For example, these loads should
   !   contain contributions from foundation stiffness and damping [not
   !   floating] or mooring line restoring and damping [floating], as well as
   !   hydrostatic and hydrodynamic contributions [offshore].  The platform
   !   loads will be applied on the platform at the instantaneous platform
   !   reference position within FAST and ADAMS.

   ! This routine assumes that the platform loads are transmitted through a
   !   medium like soil [foundation] and/or water [offshore], so that added
   !   mass effects are important.  Consequently, the routine assumes that the
   !   total platform load can be written as:
   !
   ! PtfmF(i) = SUM( -PtfmAM(i,j)*XDD(j), j=1,2,..,6) + PtfmFt(i) for i=1,2,...,6
   !
   ! where,
   !   PtfmF(i)    = the i'th component of the total load applied on the
   !                 platform; positive in the direction of positive motion of
   !                 the i'th DOF of the platform
   !   PtfmAM(i,j) = the (i,j) component of the platform added mass matrix
   !                 (output by this routine)
   !   XDD(j)      = the j'th component of the platform acceleration vector
   !   PtfmFt(i)   = the i'th component of the portion of the platform load
   !                 associated with everything but the added mass effects;
   !                 positive in the direction of positive motion of the i'th
   !                 DOF of the platform (output by this routine)

   ! The order of indices in all arrays passed to and from this routine is as
   !   follows:
   !      1 = Platform surge / xi-component of platform translation (internal DOF index = DOF_Sg)
   !      3 = Platform sway  / yi-component of platform translation (internal DOF index = DOF_Sw)
   !      3 = Platform heave / zi-component of platform translation (internal DOF index = DOF_Hv)
   !      4 = Platform roll  / xi-component of platform rotation    (internal DOF index = DOF_R )
   !      5 = Platform pitch / yi-component of platform rotation    (internal DOF index = DOF_P )
   !      6 = Platform yaw   / zi-component of platform rotation    (internal DOF index = DOF_Y )

   ! NOTE: The added mass matrix returned by this routine, PtfmAM, must be
   !       symmetric.  FAST and ADAMS will abort otherwise.
   !
   !       Please also note that the hydrostatic restoring contribution to the
   !       hydrodynamic force returned by this routine should not contain the
   !       effects of body weight, as is often done in classical marine
   !       hydrodynamics.  The effects of body weight are included within FAST
   !       and ADAMS.

SUBROUTINE UserYawCont ( YawPos, YawRate, WindDir, YawError, NumBl, ZTime, DT, DirRoot, YawPosCom, YawRateCom )


   ! This is a dummy routine for holding the place of a user-specified
   ! nacelle-yaw controller.  Modify this code to create your own device.


   ! As indicated, the yaw controller must always specify a command (demand)
   !   yaw angle, YawPosCom, AND command (demand) yaw rate, YawRateCom.
   !   Normally, you should correlate these commands so that the commanded yaw
   !   angle is the integral of the commanded yaw rate, or likewise, the
   !   commanded yaw rate is the derivative of the commanded yaw angle.  FAST
   !   WILL NOT compute these correlations for you and DOES NOT check to
   !   ensure that they are correlated.  In some situations, it is desirable to
   !   set one of the commands (either yaw angle OR yaw rate) to ZERO depending
   !   on the desired transfer function of FAST's built-in actuator model (see
   !   below for a discussion of FAST's built-in actuator model).  In general,
   !   the commanded yaw angle and rate SHOULD NEVER be defined independent of
   !   each other with BOTH commands NONZERO.


   ! The yaw controller's effect on the FAST model depends on whether or not
   !   the yaw DOF is enabled as follows:
   !
   ! YawDOF = False - If the yaw DOF is disabled, then the commanded yaw angle
   !                  and rate will be the ACTUAL yaw angle and yaw rate used
   !                  internally by FAST (in general, you should ensure these
   !                  are correlated).  In this case, any desired actuator
   !                  effects should be built within this controller.  Also in
   !                  this case, FAST WILL NOT compute the correlated yaw
   !                  acceleration, but assume that it is ZERO.  If the
   !                  commanded yaw rate is zero while the commanded yaw angle
   !                  is changing in time, then the yaw controller's effect
   !                  on yaw angle is the identical to routine PitchCntrl()'s
   !                  effect on pitch angle (i.e., routine PitchCntrl()
   !                  commands changes in pitch angle with no associated
   !                  changes in pitch rate or pitch acceleration).  For yaw
   !                  control, this situation should be avoided however, since
   !                  yaw-induced gyroscopic pitching loads on the turbine
   !                  brought about by the yaw rate may be significant.
   !
   ! YawDOF = True  - If the yaw DOF is enabled, then the commanded yaw angle
   !                  and rate, YawPosCom and YawRateCom, become the neutral
   !                  yaw angle, YawNeut, and neutral yaw rate, YawRateNeut, in
   !                  FAST's built-in second-order actuator model defined by
   !                  inputs YawSpr and YawDamp.


   ! Description of FAST's built-in actuator model:
   !
   ! In the time-domain, FAST's built-in actuator model is defined as follows:
   !
   ! YawIner*YawAccel + YawDamp*YawRate + YawSpr*YawPos
   !                             = YawDamp*YawRateNeut + YawSpr*YawNeut + YawTq
   !
   ! so that the transmitted torque is:
   !
   ! YawMom = YawSpr*( YawPos - YawNeut ) + YawDamp*( YawRate - YawRateNeut )
   !
   ! where,
   !   YawSpr      = nacelle-yaw spring constant (defined in FAST's primary
   !                 input file)
   !   YawDamp     = nacelle-yaw damping constant (defined in FAST's primary
   !                 input file)
   !   YawIner     = instantaneous inertia of the nacelle and rotor about the
   !                 yaw axis
   !   YawNeut     = the commanded (neutral) yaw angle = YawPosCom
   !   YawRateNeut = the commanded (neutral) yaw rate  = YawRateCom
   !   YawPos      = yaw angle (position)
   !   YawRate     = yaw rate
   !   YawAccel    = yaw acceleration
   !   YawTq       = torque about the yaw axis applied by external forces above
   !                 the yaw bearing, such as wind loading
   !   YawMom      = torque transmitted through the yaw bearing
   !
   ! If the commanded yaw angle and rate are correlated (so that the commanded
   !   yaw angle is the integral of the commanded yaw rate, or likewise, the
   !   commanded yaw rate is the derivative of the commanded yaw angle), then
   !   FAST's built-in second-order actuator model will have the following
   !   characteristic transfer function:
   !
   !               YawDamp*s + YawSpr             2*Zeta*OmegaN*s + OmegaN^2
   ! T(s) = -------------------------------- = --------------------------------
   !        YawIner*s^2 + YawDamp*s + YawSpr   s^2 + 2*Zeta*OmegaN*s + OmegaN^2
   !
   ! where,
   !   T(s)    = the transfer function of FAST's built-in 2nd order actuator
   !             model
   !   OmegaN  = SQRT(YawSpr/YawIner) = yaw actuator natural frequency
   !   Zeta    = YawDamp/(2*SQRT(YawSpr*YawIner)) = yaw actuator damping ratio
   !             in fraction of critical
   !
   ! If only the yaw angle is commanded, and YawRateCom is zeroed, then the
   !   charecteristic transfer function of FAST's built-in second-order
   !   actuator model simplifies to:
   !
   !                     YawSpr                            OmegaN^2
   ! T(s) = -------------------------------- = --------------------------------
   !        YawIner*s^2 + YawDamp*s + YawSpr   s^2 + 2*Zeta*OmegaN*s + OmegaN^2
   !
   ! If only the yaw rate is commanded, and YawPosCom is zeroed, then the
   !   charecteristic transfer function of FAST's built-in second-order
   !   actuator model simplifies to:
   !
   !                    YawDamp                         2*Zeta*OmegaN
   ! T(s) = -------------------------------- = --------------------------------
   !        YawIner*s^2 + YawDamp*s + YawSpr   s^2 + 2*Zeta*OmegaN*s + OmegaN^2


   ! NOTE: If you (the user) wants to switch on-or-off the yaw DOF at
   !       runtime from this user-defined routine, then do the following:
   !          (1) USE MODULE DOFs().
   !          (2) Type in "DOF_Flag(DOF_Yaw) = VALUE" where VALUE = .TRUE. or
   !              .FALSE. depending on whether you want to turn-on or turn-off
   !              the DOF, respectively.  Turning off the DOF acts is like
   !              setting YawDOF to False.
   !       This technique is useful, for example, if the yaw bearing has
   !       an electromagnetic latch that will unlock and relock the hinge under
   !       certain specified conditions.
   !       Note that this technique WILL NOT work for user-defined routines
   !       written for ADAMS datasets extracted using the FAST-to-ADAMS
   !       preprocessor.
